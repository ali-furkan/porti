# Porti
Porti is mobile dashboard for my porfolio. I manipulate the bookmarks and posts in my portfolio with porti. I actually don't know why i built porti. I know there are management applications ([airtable](https://airtable.com) etc.) .I just wanted to experience upstash and supabase in react native. Porti is a good example of using them.
